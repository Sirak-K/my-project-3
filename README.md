Battleships Game by Sirak K

The functionality behind this game is as follows:
1) Battleships are generated and randomly placed across the two players' boards.
2) There are two boards; HIDDEN_BOARD stores the ship locations and GUESS_BOARD stores the hits and misses.
3) The user is prompted to guess a row and then a column.
4) A value of HIT or MISS will be displayed depending on if the guess was correct or not.
5) The process is repeated until there are no more turns left or all the ships of a player has been sunken.
